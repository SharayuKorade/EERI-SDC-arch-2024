**In case you are not familiar with Git, here is a simple tutorial : [link]()**
All the blue colored text in the problem statements have links. You won't be able to click on the links while viewing on GitHub. So download the problem statements

## Instructions

* There are 2 questions in the [problem statement](AnimationRecruitments.pdf) ```AnimationRecruitments.pdf```. Both the questions are compulsory.
* You are free to use the internet (obviously) and any other resources.
* There is a folder dedicated for each of the questions. Put all the files related to a question in its folder. There is a ```README.md``` in each of the folders. Put any comments the corresponding ```README.md``` (It is not necessary to mention anything there - you can leave it blank). 
* If the Blender files are too big, you can upload the files to your Google Drive and put the link in README.md (in Q1, Q2 folders). If you are doing this do not forget to change the permissions to 'anyone with the link can view'.
* The deadline for submission is $2^{nd}$ March 2023, 11:59 PM. (Don't worry, we will extend the deadline for non-freshies owing to midsems in this time period).
* If you have any comments/clarifications/doubts regarding the questions, contact us on our WhatsApp group. Link to Whatsapp group: https://chat.whatsapp.com/IKuOtXWIRgvKoe1H9QDm32
